# The Weather App
This was my first project I built at DevMountain. It was built with React, CSS, Bootstrap, and The Open Weather API. [Click here](https://the-weather-app-664da7.netlify.app/) to see it live!

Update: I have since redone this project, which if you would like to take a look, [click here](https://the-weather-app-2.netlify.app/). The newest version of this project has been built with React Hooks instead of class based components. I have also made it responsive so it works on all screen sizes and also used purely css instead of Bootstrap.
