# The Weather App (My first project)

<img width="1353" alt="weather-api" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42985712/181861916-2859b8d5-7bd0-48d6-95cb-93bcf3d1efd6.PNG">

Built with React, Bootstrap, and the Open Weather API.

I would like to eventually come back to this project and make it mobile friendly, and implement different images for various weather types, as well as a better way to search for weather with better results. Since this is the free version of the API I was limited.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
