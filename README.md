# The Weather App
This was my first project I built at DevMountain. It was built with React, CSS, Bootstrap, and The Open Weather API. [Click here](https://the-weather-app-664da7.netlify.app/) to see it live!

Update: I would like to eventually come back to this project and make it mobile friendly, and implement different images for various weather types, as well as a better way to search for weather with better results. Since this is the free version of the API I was limited. Since this was my first project, and because we only had 1 week to develop it, I wasn't able to implement it the first time.
